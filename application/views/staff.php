	        <h3>Greg Berg</h3>
	        <p>Gregory Berg is an award-winning creative and multi-media storyteller who helps his clients craft compelling narratives that move people to action. His primary media is photography, which he's done professionally since 2004 when he bought his first DSLR and moved into the digital realm. Since that time, he's shot hundreds of projects for a wide range of clients including the YMCA of San Diego (and each of their 17 local branches), the University of California San Diego, The Good Life Project, and Coles Fine Flooring. He currently shoots with a Canon 7D and a variety of lenses and outboard gear that enable him to achieve the client's desired impact - whether the subject is people, architecture, or natural surroundings. He's a accomplished photo editor, retoucher, videographer/editor, and does HDR (high-dynamic range) work as well.</p>
